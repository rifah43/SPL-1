AST generator for Python

“Abstract Syntax Tree generator for Python” is a project which will convert a code written in Python
language into an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST). That is, the Abstract Syntax Tree generator will generate an
AST for Python code. An AST is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of the source
code written in a high-level programming language where each node of the tree denotes a construct
occurring in the source code.
